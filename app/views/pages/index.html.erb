  <h1>Ignacio Alonso</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a Fullstack Developer currently building <a href="https://www.codia.co">codia.co</a> a Web and Mobile development studio<br>
    Teaching web development at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/mexico">Le Wagon Mexico</a> and trying to improve 1% every day. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My current language of choice is Ruby and I enjoy making my Frontends interactive with Javascript ES6. <br> 
    I'm learning and using React but I tend to prefer the geniality of Ruby and its core principles so that's where my current focus is.

    or send me an <a href="mailto: ignacio.alley@gmail.com">email.</a> <br>
    I don't have a Facebook ðŸ¤®, LinkedIn, Or Instagram since they are quite toxic for real life connection and 
    Facebook is literally destroying the fabric of society and not caring at all.
